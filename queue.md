# Queue using a Python list

#### What is a queue?
A list of items waiting to be processed. Items are processed by a method
called FIFO (first in, first out). The first item in is the first item out.

#### Objective
Implement a queue using a Python list.

Must create a class called ListQueue.

The ListQueue class will contain the following methods:
  - enqueue - this will insert an item to the beginning of the list.
  - dequeue - this will remove the last item in the list and return the last item.
  - get_size - this will return the size of the list.


#### Extra challenge
- If you want to add a challenge consider how you would handle a queue of a
  fixed size. For example, say you only can have 10 items in your queue but
  the enqueue method is called. How would you handle that?
